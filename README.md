        - -1, if less than zero,
        - 0, if equals zero.
    
3. [Check the login](https://github.com/Jay4stem/HU_Adult-JavaScript-Examples/blob/master/Examples1.md#show-the-sign)
    - Write the code which asks for a login with prompt.
        - If the visitor enters "Admin", then prompt for a password, if the input is an empty line or Esc – show “Canceled.”, if it’s another string – then show “I don’t know you”.
    - The password is checked as follows:
        - Another string – show “Wrong password”,
